Program: 26 You are tasked with creating a system for managing sports teams in 
CHARUSAT. Each team consists of a team name, sport type (e.g., basketball, 
football), and a coach. Each coach has details such as name, age, and experience. 
Your program should: 
 Store information about multiple sports teams and their coaches. 
 Allow the user to add, search, and display team and coach information. 
Hint: Use a nested structure where the team structure contains another structure 
for coach details. 
Code: #include <stdio.h> 
#include <string.h> 
 
// Define a structure for Coach details 
struct Coach { 
    char name[50]; 
    int age; 
    int experience; // In years 
}; 
 
// Define a structure for Team details 
struct Team { 
    char teamName[50]; 
    char sportType[30]; 
    struct Coach coach; // Nested structure for coach details 
}; 
 
// Declare an array to store multiple teams 
struct Team teams[50]; 
int teamCount = 0; // Keeps track of the number of teams 
 
// Function to add a team 
void addTeam() { 
    if (teamCount >= 50) { 
        printf("Maximum team limit reached!\n"); 
        return; 
    } 
 
    printf("Enter team name: "); 
    getchar(); // Consume newline left by previous input 
    fgets(teams[teamCount].teamName, sizeof(teams[teamCount].teamName), stdin); 
    teams[teamCount].teamName[strcspn(teams[teamCount].teamName, "\n")] = '\0'; 
 
    printf("Enter sport type: "); 
    fgets(teams[teamCount].sportType, sizeof(teams[teamCount].sportType), stdin); 
    teams[teamCount].sportType[strcspn(teams[teamCount].sportType, "\n")] = '\0';

    printf("Enter coach age: "); 
    scanf("%d", &teams[teamCount].coach.age); 
 
    printf("Enter coach experience (in years): "); 
    scanf("%d", &teams[teamCount].coach.experience); 
 
    teamCount++;

// Function to search for a team by name
